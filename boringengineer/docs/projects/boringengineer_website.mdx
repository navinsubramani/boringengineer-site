# BoringEngineer Website

I created this website using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator that makes it easy to build and maintain documentation websites, as well as it is from Metas Open Source Efforts. So, I have customized it to host my blog and project documentations.

### You can find the source code of this website in my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/navinsubramani/boringengineer-site).

This website is hosted using [My Homelab setup](/docs/projects/homelab) on a self-hosted server. I use Nginx as a web server to serve this website, as well as a seperate service to host only the assets like images, videos, applications, etc.
