# LabVIEW LLM Libraries

This project hosts LabVIEW libraries that interface with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT series, enabling developers to integrate advanced natural language processing capabilities into their LabVIEW applications. This project also includes managing vector databases for embedding storage and retrieval, building agents in LabVIEW, and creating custom tools to enhance LLM interactions.

### Source Code and Documentations can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/solitontech/labview-llm-libraries/)

## Features
- **LLM Integration**: Seamlessly connect to popular LLM APIs like OpenAI, allowing for text generation, summarization, and more.
- **Vector Database Management**: Store and retrieve embeddings using vector databases, facilitating efficient similarity searches and data retrieval.
- **Agent Framework**: Build intelligent agents that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users based on LLM outputs.
- **Custom Tool Creation**: Develop custom tools and utilities to enhance the functionality and usability of LLMs within LabVIEW.
- **User-Friendly User Interface Libraries**: Pre-built UI components to simplify the integration of LLM features into LabVIEW applications.
