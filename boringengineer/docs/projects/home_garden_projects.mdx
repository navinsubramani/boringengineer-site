# Home Garden Projects
As I lived in Boston (now in New Hampshire), because of the winter season, my wife and I were unable to grow plants for almost 4-5 months. To overcome this challenge, I did few projects that helped us grow plants indoors and also in a small outdoor space. Here are some of the projects that I have done over the years.

## Raised Bed Greenhouse
I built a compact raised bed greenhouse to grow plants in a controlled environment while saving space. The greenhouse is designed to fit on a small space or small garden area, making it ideal for urban gardening enthusiasts.

## Pi Controlled Desktop Garden
I created a Raspberry Piâ€“controlled desktop garden that allows me to monitor and control my plants' environmental conditions. This project helps ensure that my plants thrive with precision. You can read the full DIY guide [here](/blog/pi-controlled-desktop-garden-diy-guide).
