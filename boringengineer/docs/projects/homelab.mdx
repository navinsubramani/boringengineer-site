# My Homelab

Home Lab is a personal server setup that allows me to experiment with various technologies, host services, and learn about system administration in a hands-on environment. I am facinated by the Homelab concept because of the flexibility and control it offers over my computing environment, as well as reduce subscription costs and avoids storing data on third-party servers.
