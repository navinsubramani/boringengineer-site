# Hacky Owl - Gamified Coding for Kids

Hacky Owl is a fun and interactive website designed for kids to learn coding by solving puzzles and challenges. This website uses gamification techniques to make learning programming concepts engaging and enjoyable for young learners. I started this experiemental work, built few games that teaches some basic coding concepts like loops, conditionals, variables, functions, etc., through interactive puzzles.

## Features Games
1. **Tic Tac Toe** - A classic game where kids can learn about arrays, loops and game logic.
2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** - A simple game that introduces conditionals like if, else, switch statements, terenary operators, etc.
3. **Array Challenges** - List of challenges that helps kids solve problems using array operations like append, count, indexof, insert, remove, reverse, sort, filter and map.

### You can find the spurce code of the project on my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/navinsubramani/hackyOWL).

In this project, I have also experimented with python running on browser using Pyodide. The code editor and the game logic are powered by Pyodide which runs python code directly in the browser without any server-side execution. This makes the website little slow, but it was a fun experiment to see how python can be used for web code development and interactive coding games.
