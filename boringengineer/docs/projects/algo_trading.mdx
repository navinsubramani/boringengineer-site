# Algorithmic Trading Bot

I have a passion towards automating the trading process using algorithms and technology. This project is focused on developing an algorithmic trading bot that can execute trades based on predefined strategies and market conditions. The bot aims to minimize human intervention, reduce emotional biases, and optimize trading performance.

NOTE: I have not made this project public yet, as this is still work in progress, and also I am worried about implication of people using it without understanding it fully. Please check back later for updates!

So far, I have been tested various strategies using histpriacal data, momentum indicators, generative ai based sentiment-analysis strategies, as well as signal scrappers. I am not greatly successful yet, but I am learning a lot in the process on all fronts (financials, market trends, algo trading strategies, coding, etc.,).

## Current Stack Used:
- TradingView (Charting and Strategy Backtesting)
- Alpaca API (Borkerage - Paper and Live trading, Data source)
- Python (Bot Logic, Data Analysis, Strategy Implementation)
- OpenAI API (Sentiment Analysis, News Analysis)
- Discord (Notifications and Alerts)
- HomeLabserver (Bot Hosting and Execution)
- GitHub (Version Control and Collaboration)
- Docker (Containerization and Deployment)
