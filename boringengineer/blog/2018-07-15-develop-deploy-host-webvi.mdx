National Instrument LabVIEW has grown and evolved a lot since its introduction in 1986 for Macintosh. Over time, NI has taken their graphical programming paradigm to most of the Operating systems, to real-time, to FPGAs and now to the web. Yes today you could build a neat Web Page quickly with your LabVIEW knowledge using NXG WebVI. In this blog, I will explain how to develop, deploy and host a simple Web Game using NXG WebVI.

- **Prerequisite:** No HTML, CSS, Javascript knowledge required. It's pure LabVIEW

## Below 'Math web game' is purely built using NI NXG WebVI

## How to do this?

### Develop a Web page using WebVI

#### Introducing WebVI

- WebVI is like a normal VI in NXG where a developer can build web pages using the available and web supported LabVIEW front panel objects and block diagram functions.
- WebVI can be translated into an HTML+CSS+Javascript function and can be run on the browser or it can also be run within the [NXG ADE](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-nxg-2.1/7290/en/)
- WebVI is run on a web browser using an open source runtime engine ([vireo](https://ni.github.io/VireoSDK/))

#### Steps to develop a Web page

- Open LabVIEW NXG
- Select **Building Applications → Getting Started with Web Application** from the lessons — a good starting point with a default application and WebVI (System Designer preconfigured)
- Open WebVI — this has Front Panel, Block Diagram, Icon and HTML pages. We’ll skip the HTML and Icon page for now
- Develop the program using the Front Panel and Block Diagram (more functions arrive as NXG matures)
- Example program screenshots below:

- Once ready, run the WebVI in the LabVIEW NXG ADE to test
- Now we have our WebVI ready to build!

### Building web application using System Designer

#### Introducing System Designer

- System Designer is an important component of the LabVIEW NXG ADE and it comes by default with every NXG project
- System Designer = NI Measurement and Automation Explorer++ and Software Library and Builds Manager++
- It manages hardware and software in one place with **Live** and **Design** views
- **Live View** auto-detects connected hardware
- **Design View** lets you simulate/design the system and build software components

#### Steps to build a Web application

- In System Designer (Design View), find the web server with the application that contains your WebVI
- Right-click the application and choose **Build**

*NXG System Designer Build Option*

- Watch build status in the status bar (make sure the WebVI isn’t running in the ADE)

### Host using NI Web Server

#### Introducing NI Web Server

- NI Web Server will serve the browser with web pages requested
- You can host any web pages once NI Web Server is configured

#### Configure NI Web Server

- Open **NI Web Server Configuration** → **Summary** → **Run guided setup to select preset settings**

<AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2018/07/NI-Web-Server-Configuration.png" alt="Using the NI Web Server Configuration to setup the server settings" />
*NI Web Server Configuration*

- Run the wizard with **Simple Local Access** (default port 80)

#### Host the built Web application

- Copy the built components into  
  `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\Web Server\htdocs`

<AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2018/07/NI-Web-Server-Hosting.png" alt="Once built, Web page should be deployed in the NI Web Server hosting folder" />
*NI Web Server hosting folder*

- Access from the browser:  
  `http://<ipaddress>:<portnumber>/<Folder inside htdocs>/<HTML file>.html`  
  **Example:** `http://localhost:80/MathGame/Math.html`

> **Note:** To host the web app in NI SystemLink follow [this procedure](https://github.com/ni/systemlink-web-interface-template).
