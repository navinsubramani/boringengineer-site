# Introduction

Hello, fellow gamers and DIY enthusiasts! Today, I'm thrilled to share the process of building a **2‑player Arcade Gaming Console**. This project not only rekindled my childhood memories but also challenged creativity and technical skills. I chose to create a **tabletop** version for its space‑saving convenience and adaptability to various table heights.

**Acknowledgment**: First off, a big shoutout to ChatGPT for helping me turn my notes and ideas into this comprehensive blog post. *\[My Edits: The above is written by ChatGPT as well]*

# Part 1: The Electronic and Software Side

#### Starting with a Prototype

Before diving into the full build, I began with a prototype focusing on the electronics and software.

#### Materials for the Prototype

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Card Reader (for installing RetroPie OS)
3. Arcade Buttons, Joystick & Controller
   • Useful resource: [Slagcoin](https://slagcoin.com/joystick.html)
   • My choice: [Amazon Purchase](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H7GF337)
4. Prototype Board (repurposed vegetable cutter)
5. Monitor

import styles from '../src/css/gallery.module.css';

  <AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2023/12/RaspberryPi.png" alt="RaspberryPi" />
</div>

#### The Build Process

This process probably takes \~4 hours in total if done right.

* Drilling 1.1‑inch holes into the vegetable‑cutter board for six buttons and a joystick.

  <AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2023/12/Vegetable-Cutter-Prototype-Board_Buttons-Mounted.jpg" alt="Prototype Board with Buttons Mounted" />
</div>

* Assembling the buttons and joystick and connecting them to the USB controller.
* Installing RetroPie OS on the Raspberry Pi (Installation guide: [RetroPie Documentation](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/First-Installation/)).
* Configuring the Pi (Wi‑Fi and location settings).
* Downloading ROMs from sites like [MAMEDEV](https://www.mamedev.org/roms/) and setting up the emulation folders.

#### Configuring Controllers

For a two‑player setup, I used a PS4 controller along with the custom‑built one. The configuration was straightforward, covering the primary buttons (A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, and Directions).

# Part 2: The Woodwork

### Transitioning from Prototype to Product

With the electronics & software sorted, it was time to focus on the console's wooden structure.

### Materials for the Console

1. All items from the prototype, including a **19‑inch Dell** monitor.
2. Speakers, Extension Power Cord, Power Tools (Drill, Sander, Circular Saw), Clamps, Wood Glue, Hammer, Measurement Tools.
3. Materials for Painting and Exterior Design (Brushes, Primer, Wooden Sticker).
4. MDF board — 1/2‑inch thickness, Dowels.

  <AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2023/12/Circular-Saw.jpg" alt="Circular Saw" />
</div>

### Detailed Woodwork Process

#### Design and Cutting

* I used the layout design from an [Instructables blog](https://www.instructables.com/2-Player-Bartop-Arcade-Machine-Powered-by-Pi/).
* Using the circular saw, cut the MDF boards to size based on the layout design.
* The side walls, with their curved edges, were particularly challenging, requiring precision and patience.

  <AssetImg path="/media/uploads/2023/12/Wood-Cutting-Dimension.jpg" alt="Wood Cutting Dimension" />
</div>

#### Assembly and Gluing

* Dowels were used to align and strengthen the joints between different parts.
* I applied wood glue generously and used clamps to hold the pieces together, allowing ample time for the glue to set.

</div>

#### Building the Control Panel

* The control panel required meticulous design, ensuring enough space for two players.
* I drilled holes for the buttons and joystick, testing their placement for ease of play.

### Final Touches

#### Painting (actually only Priming)

* I chose a primer to prepare the surface, followed by a wooden sticker for a polished look.
* The choice of a neutral color scheme was intentional, allowing for future customization.

</div>

#### Stickers

* Wooden stickers are used only for the Control Panels to give a wooden feel back after priming.

</div>

#### Wiring and Electronics Installation

* Organizing and neatly routing the wires was crucial for both aesthetics and functionality.
* I ensured easy access to the control panel for future maintenance.

</div>

#### Lighting and Aesthetics

* The console's lighting was an essential element. I cut out letters from the wooden sticker and positioned a tube light behind them for a glowing effect.
* The lighting not only added to the visual appeal but also brought the console to life.
