This is not a post about the beauty and awesomeness of Paris, I will leave that to you to experience it first hand. This is all about how I planned my solo *Une journée à Paris (A Day in Paris)*.

<!-- truncate -->

## Short Intro:
I was staying in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nijmegen,+Netherlands/@51.8428413,5.7631172,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c70867931be381:0xa48c71c89f257eac!8m2!3d51.8125626!4d5.8372264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nijmegen, Netherlands</a> at the end of winter 2018. I had plans to explore some great places in Europe and obviously, Paris was my first choice. But, but, traveling across countries to pay a first-time visit to a foreign land "alone" is not an easy deal. Here is where a good and a clear plan helps to overcome this and we don't have to worry much about where to go, how to go and when to go.

*Must note for the readers: I am not that big of a traveller and this is my first such experience.*

## Backpacking!
I made sure to carry only necessary stuff for the travel - yes, less baggage, more comfort.

**Essentials:**
- A must-have winter jacket (if an Indian wants to survive the freezing cold)
- A smart-phone with good internet and a power bank (it's almost impossible to travel without these)
- Offline Paris map saved into your phone
- Enough cash
- Sufficient clothes
- And finally my Passport (I planned for a peaceful trip ;) )

**Few more must-to-dos:**
- Packed my stuff well as Paris is also well known for muggers.
- And I let my friends and my parents know about the travel itinerary along with return dates. Now they knew where to start looking for me if I went missing!

## Prebooking travel & stay
There are lots of good options if we book the travel and stay well ahead. But my lazy bones did it just before 2 days. I got some good travel and stay ideas from two of my great colleagues in Nijmegen - A big thanks to them for being a part in making my dream come true.

<a href="https://www.goeuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goeuro</a> has all great options for travel across Europe and I used <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/service/european-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flixbus</a> to book my bus between Netherlands and France (via Belgium). <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booking.com</a> has good stay options. I was open to travel by bus and stay in a hostel as it is way cheaper as well as I get to meet and stay with strangers - one of the best experiences that a traveler gets!

**Travel suggestions for the smart pre-planners:**
- You get many 2 digit flight price options if you book well ahead
- To travel in groups and to not worry about all that I have mentioned above — <a href="https://pm2amtrips.com/user/listAllActiveTrips.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pm2am</a> is the perfect place. They organize lot of trips across Europe at a decent price.

## Choosing places to visit...
Here comes the next toughest thing. I just had one day to spend in Paris but there are a lot of tourist attractions. I made up my mind to visit only a few places so that I get some quality time to spend on each of them.

After spending few hours online and discussing with some of my friends, I decided a list of places to visit and it comes down to you and your taste always. Talking about taste, I did have lunch at our very own Saravana Bhavan - sitting in negative and drinking a steaming hot Madras Filter coffee is a bliss even when you are not a coffee lover like me.

*Everything except my bill was good :)*

And here is my list,
- Eiffel Tower
- Trocadero Gardens
- Louvre Museum
- Sacre-Coeur
- Arc de Triomphe
- Notre-Dame Cathedral

## Traveling within Paris...
After deciding on the list of places to visit, I did a manual shortest pathfinding to keep the travel time between the places to a minimum.

The train is the best option to travel within Paris - the infrastructure connects almost every places in Paris and we need to barely walk to any location from a train station. I also did a quick analysis using <a href="https://parisbytrain.com/paris-transportation-zone-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris Transportation Zone</a> to understand the zones my list would cover and bought a day train pass to those zones alone.

From this point onwards, I just had to travel around, sticky to my plan and enjoy my solo day in Paris!

By the way, traveling in the train is also fun!
