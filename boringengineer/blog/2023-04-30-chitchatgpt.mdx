This blog post is about an experiment I did where I had two instances of GenAI models talk to each other. I call this experiment "ChitChatGPT". The idea was to see how well two AI models could hold a conversation with each other without any human intervention.

Have you ever wondered what a conversation between your favorite characters would sound like, or wanted to see how two entirely different personas might interact with each other or make fictional characters like companies, drinks, seasons and many more? talk about random topics. Now you can, with the free **Chit-Chat-GPT** application powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo that brings fictional conversations to life!

**The Idea:**
1. This simple, yet engaging, web application allows users to enter two character names and a topic that the characters should speak about. By harnessing the power of GPT-3.5-turbo, I have created a web page that generates entertaining conversations based on the characters and topics you choose.
2. This is also a way to evaluate how these models are trained and tuned to respond, avoiding hate speeches, being less aggressive and as polite as possible during conversations.
3. This can be improved to make two different models talk to each other or debate and we can evaluate the smartest ones.

**How It Works:**

Behind the scenes, this utilizes two instances of OpenAI GPT, one for each character. These AI-driven language models engage in a dynamic conversation about the chosen topic, resulting in a fascinating back-and-forth that you can watch unfold. The conversation is limited to exchanges only 10 messages now.

**Some Example conversation idea from GPT-4:**
1. Batman & James Bond on the importance of having cool gadgets.
2. Netflix & YouTube on binge-watching habits and the funniest viral videos.
3. Trump & Greta Thunberg on their favorite pizza toppings
4. Mona Lisa & Kim Kardashian on mastering the art of the enigmatic smile and the perfect selfie
5. Christopher Columbus & Dora the Explorer on the most memorable adventures and travel mishaps.
