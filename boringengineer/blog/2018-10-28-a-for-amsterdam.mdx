Amsterdam is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe with its canals, bikes, architecture, and vibrant culture. During my visit in October 2018, I was captivated by the blend of historical charm and modern lifestyle that the city offers. This is a **photologue** of my trip to Amsterdam.

From a 'small fishing village' in the 12th century to one of the loved tourism place, Amsterdam has got everything. Though Amsterdam is best known for its nightlife, I could only take a day walk into the city, still it's an amazing experience.

Amsterdam Centraal is the largest railway station in Amsterdam. Its one of the busiest railway station with 162,000 passengers every day.

Amsterdam is known for its canals which you can find all over the city, that means you can boat to anywhere you want.
