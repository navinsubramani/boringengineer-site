The Island country in the North Atlantic ocean is made of beautiful landscapes and unpredictable weather. In a span of 2 hours, you could experience a cool breeze, windy, rainy and sunny weather with some occasional snows added during winter but never extreme weather. I drove from Limerick to Cliffs of Mohar on Febrarury, and for every 10 min, I had to go from Rain Wiper to Sun Shades to Rain Wiper again - this adds some spice to your journey. Ireland is known for its Wild Atlantic Way, Cliffs and Mountains - apart from Irish music and beers - anyplace in Ireland either has beers or cliffs!!

### Cliff of Mohar

Cliff of Mohar is one of the best sceneries that you can get in Ireland. When the Ocean, Cliffs, Grass and Sunset combines it provides the unforgettable memory.

The formation of cliffs is incredible and long, you can walk by the cliffs as far as you can and it feels like it never ends. According to the data, they run for around 14kms and raise up to 120mts. Some part of the cliffs are unprotected and dangerous & the best way to enjoy is to keep your distance from the edges.

The winds are sometimes soothing and sometimes stronger, but it will make you spend hours there just staring at the never-ending ocean & feel the winds. If the weather blesses you - the best time is with lighter winds and no rains.

### Dingle Drive

The horseshoe ride in the dingle is one of the exciting rides - the roads go parallel to cliffs with very short turns and narrow roads - closed by rocks in one side and the unending ocean on other.

When you enter the Dingle, inch beach awaits you - the long beach drive and I am lucky to end up in the quiet time of the year.

Fungie Dolphin spot is the start of the Dingle Spin that gives an opportunity to drive near the cliffs in a wild Atlantic way. Have good food & take a ride along the cliffs.
