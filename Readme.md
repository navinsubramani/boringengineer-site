# Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the boringengineer website, which is built using Docusaurus, a modern static website generator. The site serves as a personal platform for me to share his experiences in engineering, technology, and life.

# To Do (12 hours)
- [ ] Port all the blogs from the old site to this new Docusaurus site. This will ensure that all my previous writings are accessible in the new format. (20 mins per blog - 7 hours)

- [ ] Add a DIY section to showcase my projects and experiments. This section should include detailed descriptions and images of my work. (3 hours)

- [ ] Create redirects for the failed links from the old site to the new site. This will ensure that visitors can still access the site even if the content is not moved or broken. (2 hours)

# Take Down Old Site (5 hours)

- [ ] Once the new site is fully functional. Take down the old site domain and redirect to the new site using cloudflare. This will ensure that all traffic is directed to the new site and that users are not confused by the old content.
- [ ] Unsubscribe from the old site domain and remove it from the hosting provider. This will free up resources and prevent any confusion about which site is the official one.
