# Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the boringengineer website, which is built using Docusaurus, a modern static website generator. The site serves as a personal platform for me to share his experiences in engineering, technology, and life.

This repository contains details for two main services:
1. **Boring Engineer Site**: This is under `/boringengineer` directory and contains the source code for the main website. This webiste is built using Docusaurus and includes blog posts, project documentation, and other content. It does not include the large media files, which are hosted separately.
2. **nginx-webserver**: This is under `/nginx` directory and contains the configuration files for the nginx web server that hosts the boringengineer media assets.

Note: `/docs` contains some design files used to create the website logo and other graphics.

# Getting Started

To get started with the boringengineer website or nginx server, follow the instructions in the respective README files located in each directory.

# Purpose

This repo is made public so fellow engineers can take inspirations from the site or provide feedback to improve the content and structure. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or suggest improvements.
